   Mouse monoclonal antibodies were prepared using His-tagged Tn10-encoded metal-tetracycline/H+ antiporter [TetA(B)His] as an antigen. From them, those reacting equally with His-tagged and wild-type TetA(B) were selected and named TCL-1. Cysteine-scanning mutants were used to determine the TCL-1 binding site on the TetA(B) protein. First, 12 Cys mutants of TetA(B) in which one residue in a protruding loop region was replaced by cysteine were constructed. Western blot analysis revealed the binding of TCL-1 to all of these Cys-mutants except for R186C. Then, we constructed 13 cysteine-scanning mutants, F179C to T191C. Among them, eight mutants, F179C to T182C, N184C, and T189C to T191C, exhibited TCL-1 binding, whereas the other five, K183C, T185C, R186C, D187C, and N188C, exhibited no or lower TCL-1 binding. These results clearly indicate that the sequence recognized by TCL-1 is 183Lys-X-Thr-Arg-Asp-Asn188 in the central loop region of TetA(B). TCL-1 is the first reported antibody that binds to a region other than the C-terminus of TetA(B), and the recognized amino acid sequence was identified.
