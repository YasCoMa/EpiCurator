  <AbstractText>
   HLA-B35 has consistently been associated with rapid HIV disease progression, particularly alleles of the Px group. As B35 is the most prevalent HLA-B in Mexico, we investigated HIV disease outcome in relation to HLA expression in a large cohort (n=976) of Mexicans. Contrary to the previous studies, no impact on viral load or CD4 cell count was observed in association with the B35 PY/Px groups. However, we observed differences in HIV disease outcome associated with specific HLA-B35 alleles.
