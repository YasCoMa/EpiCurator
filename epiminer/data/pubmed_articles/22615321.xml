  <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">
   Sindbis virus (SINV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus found in Eurasia, Africa, and Oceania. Clinical SINV infection is characterized by febrile rash and arthritis and sometimes prolonged arthralgia and myalgia. The pathophysiological mechanisms of musculoskeletal and rheumatic disease caused by SINV are inadequately understood.

  <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">
   We studied the muscle pathology of SINV infection ex vivo by examining a unique muscle biopsy obtained from a patient with chronic myalgia and arthralgia 6 months after acute SINV infection and assessed potential genetic predisposing factors by determining the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and complement factor C4 genes and proteins. In addition, we performed in vitro SINV infections of primary human myoblasts and myotubes.

  <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">
   In the muscle biopsy we found evidence of muscle regeneration due to previous necrotic lesions likely caused by earlier SINV infection. We showed that human myoblasts and myotubes were susceptible in vitro for SINV infection as the cells became immunoreactive for viral antigens and cytopathic effect was observed. The patient was homozygous for HLA-B*35 alleles and heterozygous for HLA-DRB1*01 and HLA-DRB1*03 alleles and had total deficiency of C4B protein.

   This study provides new insights concerning pathological processes leading to chronic symptoms in SINV infection and demonstrates for the first time the susceptibility of human myogenic cells to SINV infection.
