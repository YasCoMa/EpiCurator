  <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">
   Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) are the 2 types of lymphoma that represent the third most common childhood malignancy. Multiple etiological factors are involved in lymphoma pathogenesis, including viral infection, immune deficiencies, environmental agents, and genetic factors. Strong arguments supporting a genetic linkage between the susceptibility to lymphomas and human leukocyte antigens (HLA) are reported and give an idea about susceptibility or protection from the disease.

   Seventy-one cases were included in this study: 36 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 35 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. Their ages ranged from 4 to 18 years. The control group consisted of 70 unrelated healthy individuals, with a mean age of 5 to 17 years. The genotype of HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-DR, and HLA-DQ alleles was typed by means of PCR sequence-specific priming.

  <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">
   HLA-B*18, HLA-DRB1*03, *07, and HLA-DQB1*02 were significantly increased in patients with lymphomas when compared with controls, whereas HLA-DRB1*13 and DQB1*03 were significantly decreased when compared with controls.

  <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">
   These results indicate that HLA-B*18, DRB1*03, *07, and DQB1*02 may contribute to lymphoma susceptibility, whereas HLA-DRB1*13 and DQB1*03 may confer protection to lymphoma in the Algerian population.
