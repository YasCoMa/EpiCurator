   Due to the current Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the rapid discovery of a safe and effective vaccine is an essential issue. Consequently, this study aims to predict a potential COVID-19 peptide-based vaccine utilizing the Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) and Spike Glycoprotein (S) via the Immunoinformatics approach. To achieve this goal, several Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) tools, molecular docking, and safety prediction servers were used. According to the results, The Spike peptide
   <b>
    SQCVNLTTRTQLPPAYTNSFTRGVY
   </b>
   is predicted to have the highest binding affinity to the B-Cells. The Spike peptide
   <b>
    FTISVTTEI
   </b>
   has the highest binding affinity to the Major Histocompatibility Complex class 1 (MHC I) Human Leukocyte Allele HLA-B*1503 (according to the MDockPeP and HPEPDOCK servers, docking scores were -153.9 and -229.356, respectively). The Nucleocapsid peptides
   <b>
    KTFPPTEPK
   </b>
   and
   <b>
    RWYFYYLGTGPEAGL
   </b>
   have the highest binding affinity to the MHC I HLA-A0202 allele and the three the Major Histocompatibility Complex class 2 (MHC II) Human Leukocyte Allele HLA-DPA1*01:03/DPB1*02:01, HLA-DQA1*01:02/DQB1-*06:02, HLA-DRB1, respectively. Docking scores of peptide
   <b>
    KTFPPTEPK
   </b>
   were -153.9 and -220.876. In contrast, docking scores of peptide
   <b>
    RWYFYYLGTGPEAGL
   </b>
   were ranged from 218 to 318. Furthermore, those peptides were predicted as non-toxic and non-allergen. Therefore, the combination of those peptides is predicted to stimulate better immunological responses with respectable safety.
