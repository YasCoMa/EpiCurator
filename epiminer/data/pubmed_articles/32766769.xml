   We present the first published case of raltegravir-associated drug-reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome in a child without characteristic human leukocyte antigen haplotypes HLA-B*57:01 or HLA-B*53:01. A 4-year-old African American female with perinatally acquired human immunodeficiency virus infection was hospitalized for DRESS after starting a raltegravir-based antiretroviral regimen.
