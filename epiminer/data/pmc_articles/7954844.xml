  Shotgun transcriptome, spatial omics, and isothermal profiling of SARS-CoV-2 infection reveals unique host responses, viral diversification, and drug interactions
 </title>
 <abstract>
  <p id="Par1">
   In less than nine months, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) killed over a million people, including &gt;25,000 in New York City (NYC) alone. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 highlights clinical needs to detect infection, track strain evolution, and identify biomarkers of disease course. To address these challenges, we designed a fast (30-minute) colorimetric test (LAMP) for SARS-CoV-2 infection from naso/oropharyngeal swabs and a large-scale shotgun metatranscriptomics platform (total-RNA-seq) for host, viral, and microbial profiling. We applied these methods to clinical specimens gathered from 669 patients in New York City during the first two months of the outbreak, yielding a broad molecular portrait of the emerging COVID-19 disease. We find significant enrichment of a NYC-distinctive clade of the virus (20C), as well as host responses in interferon, ACE, hematological, and olfaction pathways. In addition, we use 50,821 patient records to find that renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors have a protective effect for severe COVID-19 outcomes, unlike similar drugs. Finally, spatial transcriptomic data from COVID-19 patient autopsy tissues reveal distinct

     Introduction
    </title>
    <p id="Par3">
     In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)     . Since the start of the pandemic, more than &gt;100 million cases and 2 million deaths have been reported (
     <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu">
      https://coronavirus.jhu.edu

     ), with an especially high burden of early cases in New York City (NYC). Genomic epidemiology efforts have already played a crucial public health role in confirming community spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the USA     as well as in China     and around the world     . However, standard approaches to viral profiling (i.e., qRT-PCR or targeted methods) fail to provide information on either the host immune response or microbial co-infections, both of which might impact the clinical presentation of COVID-19 and provide directions for therapeutic intervention and management.
    </p>
    <p id="Par4">
     Studies of SARS infection have shown that regulation of the innate immune response is associated with the development of adaptive immunity and disease severity. Moreover, a robust inflammatory response is characterized by an upregulation of cytokines including IL-6, IL-10, and MCP-1 in tissues and serum, as well as infiltration of infected tissues by inflammatory cells such as macrophages     . SARS-CoV-2 infection studies have shown that viral load peaks during the first week of illness, which may account for the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2     . Furthermore, antibody profiling by     demonstrates both IgM and IgG antibodies began to increase around the 10th day after symptom onset, and most patients had seroconversion within the first 3 weeks of infection, underscoring the need for rapid testing in the acute phase of infection. Moreover, phenotyping of COVID-19 patients has also been shown to identify molecular signatures to distinguish severity of symptoms     , but limited information about the association of the viral sequences and outcome exists, nor viral propagation within human tissues.
    </p>
    <p id="Par5">
     To better understand the impact and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we applied a multi-platform and molecular diagnostic approach to samples collected during the outbreak in NYC. Out of concern for the scalability and sensitivity of standard diagnostic assays (qRT-PCR), we developed and validated a rapid reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection from nasopharyngeal swab specimens and oropharyngeal swab lysates. We simultaneously developed a large-scale host and viral profiling platform employing shotgun metatranscriptomics (total RNA-seq). We applied this total RNA-seq platform to 732 clinical samples, including 669 confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases at New York-Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center (NYPH-WCMC). In addition, we report an observational study of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors and severe COVID-19 outcomes using data (

    <p id="Par6">
     Our results define and map the viral genetic features of the NYC outbreak and associate specific host responses and gene expression perturbations with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also link findings from host transcriptomics to findings from clinical data related to the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) pathway using patients at two NYPH sites. Finally, we used spatial transcriptomics to map ACE expression in SARS-CoV-2 infected lungs from COVID-19 patient autopsies. We have made these data available in the database of genotypes and phenotypes (dbGAP) and also in an interactive analytics portal to enable others to explore additional genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical covariate associations (

      Validation of LAMP for detection of SARS-CoV-2
     </title>
     <p id="Par7">
      We developed a colorimetric assay to quickly detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 viral load in patient samples, using a set of LAMP primers and simple single-tube protocol (Fig.      ). To validate the assay, we first evaluated two synthetic RNAs (see “Methods”) whose sequences matched the viral sequences of patients from Wuhan, China and Melbourne, Australia (Supplementary Fig.      ). The reaction output was measured at 0-, 20-, and 30 min intervals (Fig.      ) before the samples were heated to 95 °C for inactivation. LAMP fluorescence correlated closely with SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral copies (Fig.      ), with an overlap of the median signal from negative controls at lower levels (0–10 total copies per reaction) of viral RNA (
      <italic>
       n
      </italic>
      = 10). The LoD was found to be between 5 and 25 viral total copies for the dual primer, single-tube reaction (N gene and E gene), and this was then replicated to show a similar LoD on the second synthetic control (Supplementary Fig.      ).
     </p>
     <p id="Par8">
      We next used a set of 201 samples from known or suspected COVID-19 cases that were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by a commercial qRT-PCR assay (Altona) that has been a standard clinical test at NYPH-WCMC since early March. These comprised 69 nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples that tested positive (qRT-PCR positives, Ct &lt; 40) and 132 samples that tested negative (qRT-PCR negative, Ct ≥ 40) (see “Methods”). qRT-PCR positive samples showed a much higher LAMP fluorescence than qRT-PCR negative samples. Analysis of Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves yielded an overall sensitivity of 95.6% and specificity of 99.2% (Fig.      , Supplementary Fig.      ). These results were also confirmed with a capture-based SARS-CoV-2 panel from Twist (Supplementary Fig.      ). Of note, we obtained similar performance on bulk oropharyngeal swab lysate (Supplementary Fig.      ), including increasing reaction sensitivity as a function of viral copy number, but with deteriorating performance Ct &gt; 30. We observed higher LAMP sensitivity at higher viral loads, as determined by qRT-PCR Ct values (Supplementary Fig.      ).

      Shotgun metatranscriptomics platform for viral and bacterial detection
     </title>
     <p id="Par9">
      To further investigate the biological characteristics of qRT-PCR positive and negative specimens, as well as to compare to RT-LAMP, we developed a shotgun metatranscriptomics platform utilizing total RNA-seq (RNA-sequencing with ribosomal RNA depletion) to profile all RNAs from patient specimens (Fig.      ). We sequenced 857 RNA-seq libraries (Fig.      ) across 732 specimens from 669 patients treated for influenza-like illness (ILI) at NYPH-WCMC to an average of 63.2M read pairs per sample. This included 215 qRT-PCR positive samples (201 of which were also tested with LAMP), 17 positive (Vero E6 cells), and 33 negative (buffer) controls. To assess the ability of deep shotgun transcriptomics to identify qRT-PCR false negatives, including those that might arise from uncharacterized SARS-Cov-2 variants, we sequenced 517 qRT-PCR negative samples. Among these qRT-PCR negative samples, 311 were tested for the standard clinical respiratory virus panel (BioFire, which included several common cold coronavirus strains and influenza virus).

     <p id="Par10">
      First, the taxonomic composition of samples was detailed by aligning total RNA-seq reads to the human reference genome GRCh38 and NCBI reference databases (see “Methods”). Kraken2 classification of non-human sequences revealed abundant bacterial and SARS-CoV-2 RNA among qRT-PCR positive samples and infrequent mappings to fungi, archaea, or other viruses (Fig.      ). Positive controls and clinical samples with medium/high-viral load-consistent qRT-PCR Ct values were significantly (
      <italic>
       p
      </italic>
      &lt; 1 × 10      ) enriched in SARS-CoV-2 genome alignments (median reads per kilobase per million mapped reads, RPKM) relative to negative controls and qRT-PCR negative clinical samples (Fig.      ). LAMP fluorescence, qRT-PCR Ct values, and total-RNA Seq RPKM showed consistent estimates of SARS-CoV-2 viral abundance across these three technologies and 201 clinical specimens (

      = −0.80) (Supplementary Fig.      ). Analysis of SARS-Cov-2 read coverage across 517 qRT-PCR negative samples revealed 7 (1.3%) samples with more than 0.01% of reads matching SARS-CoV-2. In summary, these results indicate close concordance with SARS-Cov-2 viral load across diverse diagnostic platforms, with rare examples of occult SARS-Cov-2 infection among qRT-PCR negative cases.
     </p>
     <p id="Par11">
      Next, an analysis of total RNA-seq sequences showed the presence of commensal species and viruses across both qRT-PCR positives and negative samples (Fig.      ). We found a statistically significant higher load of other (i.e., non-SARS-CoV-2) respiratory viruses in qRT-PCR negative vs. positive samples (Wilcoxon test,
      <italic>
       P
      </italic>
      = 0.0008) (Fig.      ). Oral and airway commensal taxa were compared between the high-viral load group and other patient categories using linear modeling in log-normal space using MaAsLin2 package (see methods) and relative to the negative controls. This includes a correction for the SARS-CoV-2 or
      <italic>

      matching reads, which can show variable depth of coverage due to higher SARS-CoV-2 fraction in the high-viral load group. After this correction, 17 species were significantly depleted in COVID-19 patients, including

      (Supplementary Fig.      ).

     <p id="Par12">
      Among respiratory viruses discovered across all patients (COVID+ and COVID−), we found frequent Influenza A (23% of viral positive cases), rhinovirus A (16%), and human metapneumovirus (12%). Overall, we found close concordance between these results and the findings of a transcriptomics based viral detection to the results of a standard (BioFire) respiratory pathogen PCR panel performed within 7 days of the NP swab used for RNA sequencing (
      <italic>
       N
      </italic>
      = 356 patients across 404 tests) (Fig.      ). The metatranscriptomics platform yielded an Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.890 (F-score = 0.725), and an accuracy of 0.994, sensitivity of 0.758, specificity of 0.997, and precision of 0.694 (see methods). These data also enabled an examination of co-infection within COVID+ patients. Among qRT-PCR positive cases, only 7 (3.2%) harbored sequences mappable to other respiratory viruses. Among these, we found human coronaviruses 229E, NL63 and HKU1, influenza A, and human mastadenovirus and metapneumovirus (Fig.      ). In summary, these results indicate that common respiratory viruses were frequently implicated in many Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases that were COVID-, and demonstrate low incidence of co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 with other respiratory viruses (3.2%), matching results (3%) from other studies      .

      SARS-CoV-2 assemblies from shotgun metatranscriptomes
     </title>
     <p id="Par13">
      The abundance of SARS-CoV-2 alignments from total RNA-seq was sufficient to provide &gt;10× coverage of the viral genomes and yield high quality, full-length assemblies for 155 samples (Supplementary Fig.      ). When examining the viral genomes, we identified a total of 1147 instances of 165 unique variants across 155 assemblies, including 1143 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and four deletions. We compared the 155 full-length NYPH-WCMC sequences with 46,581 SARS-CoV-2 sequences obtained from a recent GISAID build (downloaded on 6/16/2020) using the Nextstrain pipeline      (Fig.      , see Methods). We generated full-length SARS-CoV-2 assemblies for 9 of 517 (1.7%) of samples that were found negative by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig.      ). Each of these demonstrated a high RPKM viral load, an abundance of reads evenly covering the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and high (&gt;0.5) variant allele fractions (VAFs) of SNV’s commonly seen in other positive samples and GISAID (Supplementary Fig.      ). These results indicate that qRT-PCR false negatives can occur, but are rare.
     </p>
     <p id="Par14">
      We then used a New York State-focused build of Nextstrain resulting in the incorporation of our 155 genomes with 3541 sequences from GISAID (Fig.      ). Analyzing worldwide groupings annotated by the Nextstrain database, we found a high proportion (&gt;74%, 116/155) of our assemblies were associated with clade 20C (Fig.      ), which overall represents 17% of strains in the GISAID build. Our metatranscriptomic assembly-based clade assignments for NYC strains were consistent with those obtained by parallel targeted-sequencing based studies from the same period (Fig.      ). Investigating the geographical and temporal distribution of non-NYC samples in 20C, we found a global distribution with a likely origin in Western Europe (Fig.      ). The first noted cases of 20C in GISAID were recovered in France on 2/21/2020, but since then, this clade has represented a minority (&lt;20%) of Western European cases. In contrast, 20C represented a steady majority of (&gt;70%) of NYC cases from March to May 2020. Interestingly, 20C was relatively rare (&lt;50%) in other regions of the US in March, but increased through June. The most striking increase was in the southern USA, where 20C began under 30% prevalence in March and rose to above 80% prevalence in May and June. The SNVs defining the 20C clade were non-synonymous variants targeting genes encoding the nonstructural protein 2 (NSP2), the viral replicase, and ORF3a, a poorly characterized SARS-CoV-2 protein with putative roles in inflammation      . These observations refine the results of a previous study that associated NYC cases with clade A2a      . This clade is defined by the presence of the Spike p.D614G mutations and comprises a superset of 20C.
     </p>
     <p id="Par15">
      While the majority of the known variation in SARS-Cov-2 represents SNVs, one hundred distinct deletion variants have been reported in previous analyses      . Of the four deletions we detected in our assemblies, three represented the same in-frame deletion in nsp1 (p.141_143del) (Supplementary Fig.      ). This deletion was well supported by reads in our samples (Supplementary Fig.      ). While it was not exclusive to genomes from our study, we only detected this deletion in 168 GISAID genomes (0.3%). Interestingly, rather than forming a single monophyletic subclade, genomes carrying this deletion spanned all major SARS-Cov-2 clades (19A: 12, 19B: 4, 20A: 68, 20B: 30, 20c: 53, none: 4) suggesting that this deletion may have evolved many times during SARS-CoV-2 community spread (Supplementary Fig.      ). In addition, while the dominant (171/172) version of this deletion involved the in-frame deletion of nucleotide positions 686-694, a single genome included an alternative in-frame deletion of positions 684–692, resulting in the same amino-acid deletion.
     </p>
     <p id="Par16">
      Variant calling of assemblies and RNA-seq reference alignments showed most (87.5%) variants have VAFs &gt;0.95 and high (&gt;100) numbers of variant-supporting reads. Analysis of VAF posterior probability distributions identified a subset of alleles whose VAFs were confidently (probability &gt; 0.95) above 0.05 but below 0.95 (Fig.      ). We labeled these alleles as “het” (heterogenous) variants and refer to the remaining (high VAF) consensus assembly variants as "homogeneous.” Many of these het variants were associated with robust read support despite frequently having VAFs below 0.05 and not being incorporated into the consensus assembly sequence. (Supplementary Fig.      ). These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 samples frequently harbor minority viral populations, which can be detected and characterized with shotgun metatranscriptomics. The relatively large numbers of these het variants (&gt;10) in a subset of cases, presumably arising during the course of a single infection and then rising to a reasonably high oligoclonal VAFs (0.1–0.2) level, suggests that this intrahost diversification may be rapid and also associated with positive selection.

      We then leveraged the total RNA-seq profiles to better understand the host transcriptome during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cell proportion analyses using the MUSIC deconvolution algorithm showed enriched proportions of cell types spanning goblet, ciliated airway, and epithelial cells across all samples (Supplementary Fig.      ). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were calculated using limma voom and DESeq2 (see “Methods”). Overall, 757 significant DEGs (

      Differentially expressed host genes indicated a wide range of antiviral responses, including a common interferon response across all ranges of viral levels, which was significantly higher when compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative samples that harbored other respiratory viruses (Fig.      ). Notably, host cells showed an increase in angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (

      value = 1.4 × 10      ), which is the SARS-CoV-2 cellular receptor      . This critical gene for viral entry      exhibited an expression level concomitant with the higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 virus, along with IFI27 (Interferon Alpha Inducible Protein 27,
      <italic>

      &lt; 2.2 × 10      ). The DEGs also included HERC6 (HECT Containing E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase Family Member 6), which aids Class I MHC-mediated antigen processing and Interferon-Stimulated Genes (ISGs) (Fig.      ), underscoring the impact of the virus on these cells’ immune response      . Also, a subset of cytokines (CXCL10, CXCL11, and CCL8) showed the highest spike of expression in the higher viral load sub-group, matching previous results from animal models and infected cells      . Of note, these expression patterns significantly overlapped with those taken from an independent cohort (UCSF) of 286 NP swabs also processed by RNA-seq (see Methods and Supplementary Fig.      ,

      ACE inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker usage correlates with COVID-19

      gene expression in patients with high SARS-CoV-2 viral load, we investigated the interplay of receiving pharmacologic angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for hypertension and clinical features of COVID-19. Since ACE2 expression can be increased in patients taking ACEIs and ARBs      , the observed correlation of viral titer with ACE2 expression may be attributed to the pre-infection use of such inhibitors, which is common in older patients and those with comorbidities      .

      ACEI/ARB have a number of indications in addition to hypertension, so confounding variables remains a challenge. To address this issue, we repeated the analysis in a cohort of individuals with recent exposure to one of four antihypertensive medication classes: ACEI/ARB, beta blockers (BB), calcium channel blockers (CCB), and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics (THZ)). Evaluating each drug class separately using PSM and covariate adjustment, we found the rate of intubation was consistently lower for ACEI/ARB exposure (CUIMC HR = 0.74, CI: 0.64–0.85, WCMC HR = 0.73, CI: 0.56–0.95) and higher for THZ exposure (CUIMC HR = 1.96, CI: 1.67–2.31, WCMC HR = 1.90, 1.42–2.55). Conversely, we found no statistically significant associations for CCB (CUIMC HR = 0.92, 0.81–1.05, WCMC HR = 1.04, CI: 0.83–1.30), and only weak evidence of positive associations between intubation and BB exposure (CUIMC HR = 1.16, CI: 1.03–1.31, WCMC HR = 1.04, CI: 0.84–1.27). Meanwhile, we found consistently lower rates of death among patients with ACEI/ARB (CUIMC HR = 0.82, CI: 0.71–0.93, WCMC HR = 0.67, CI: 0.52–0.87), BB (CUIMC HR = 0.81, CI: 0.71–0.91, WCMC HR = 0.74, CI: 0.61–0.91), and CCB (CUIMC HR = 0.63, CI: 0.55–0.72, WCMC HR = 0.69, CI: 0.55–0.86) exposures, while THZ exposure had harmful associations (CUIMC HR = 1.03, CI: 0.87–1.22, WCMC HR = 1.43, CI: 1.04–1.96). In summary, among SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with recent exposure to antihypertensive drugs, ACEI/ARBs were the only class which were associated with lower risk of intubation, while ACEI/ARB, BB, and CCB use was negatively associated with death.

      Spatial expression data

      We next used a spatial transcriptomic technology (GeoMx) to characterize the distribution of a set of &gt;1800 genes (the GeoMx Cancer Transcriptome Atlas probe set, or CTA) across tissues from four COVID-19 patients who died and then received an autopsy (Fig.      ); these were compared to three normal lung donors (excess lung material from healthy lung transplant donors). Samples were processed using the Nanostring GeoMx protocols (see methods), including illuminating and UV-cleaving the antibody-linked probes for Areas of Interest (AOIs) within the patients’ lung FFPE sections and alveoli, followed by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) profiling on the Illumina NextSeq500. These data showed spatially-restricted expression of ACE2 at the perimeter of the alveoli (Fig.      ), as well as the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in some of the same sections.

      We then used cellular deconvolution methods based on the CTA data across the 107 total AOIs (69 COVID+ and 38 COVID−) to characterize the types of cells present in the lung. The cell proportions showed an increase in macrophages present in the lung tissue (Fig.      ) compared to normal donors, particularly for patient #3, where 30–52% of the cells found within the AOIs were macrophages, as well as patient #4 (up to 18%). In contrast, normal lung samples showed &lt;1% across all AOIs tested (

      = 38 total AOIs). Of note, patient #1 showed up to 3.8% presence of neutrophils in the AOIs profiled, compared to no detectable presence in normal donors (Fig.      , Supplementary Fig.      ). Both of these enrichments represent unique cellular distributions in the COVID-19 patients relative to normal donors, and agrees with reports of immune cell-mediated influence of inflammation for COVID-19 patients.

     Discussion

    <p id="Par26">
     In summary, these data showed that total RNA-sequencing data has great promise as a comprehensive and accurate host and pathogen profiling method. The RNA-seq data enabled a complete genetic map of the viruses, bacteria, host responses, and even HLA subtypes from the sample data source. Of note, a significant subset of our samples, including in nine qRT-PCR negative cases, had sufficient reads to assemble the SARS-CoV-2 genome de novo. Though these likely qRT-PCR false negatives could not be attributed to specific sequence changes (e.g., primer site mutations), their high frequency underscores the limitation of “gold standard” qRT-PCR approaches for SARS-CoV-2 detection. These results also highlight the need for open-source primer design, so these assays can be updated as a more granular picture of strain diversity and evolution is obtained through worldwide sequence efforts     . Nevertheless, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 assemblies or reads among qRT-PCR negative cases with ILI symptoms was low, despite a comprehensive search for these sequences among shotgun transcriptomics reads. These results indicate that existing standard detection methods are reasonably adapted to patterns of SARS-CoV-2 strain variation.

     Notably, our phylogenetic analysis shows that the 20C clade comprises the majority of known NYC samples, including those sequenced outside of this study     . Though remaining NYC cases show a wide distribution across all identified clades, the predominance (&gt;80% in NYC) of such a narrowly defined set of sequences within NYC from a minority (≤20%) Western European suggests either a founder effect or differential strain fitness. Though the Spike D614G mutation, which defines a superclade of 20C previously known as A2a     , has been proposed to increase transmissibility (e.g., via higher viral load), and the low and stable prevalence of 20C in Western Europe since March suggests against differential fitness as an explanation for its dominance in NYC. A more likely explanation involves the early introduction and expansion of one or several 20C cases to NYC in late February, e.g., via the New Rochelle cluster. The gradual increases of 20C in the remainder of the USA post March may similarly reflect migration patterns of New Yorkers to the South and Midwest.

     Our results further demonstrate the value of RNA-seq data by revealing distinct, host transcriptional programs that were activated during viral infection of the naso-/oropharynx with SARS-CoV-2. This includes upregulation of specific interferon pathway genes (

     ) that have been previously associated with the innate antiviral host immune response against other positive-strand RNA viruses (e.g., hepatitis C, Dengue virus). These results also provide clinical relevance for recently published results from animal and cellular models of SARS-CoV-2     . Our analyses also implicate expression perturbations of the ACE pathway in SARS-CoV-2 host response, including
     <italic>
      ACE2
     </italic>
     , and map these patterns from COVID-19 lung samples from autopsies     . Patients presenting with COVID-19 frequently harbor comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart diseases, all of which have been associated with increased disease severity     . Since these comorbidities are frequently treated with ACEIs and ARBs, one possibility is that these medications may make patients more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but this has been limited in prior studies.
    </p>
    <p id="Par29">
     Here, we examined the risk of medication use and comorbidities in the context of ACEI or ARB in a large, retrospective clinical analysis of 50,821 patient records. These data show that patients with ACEI/ARB exposure had lower risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, after adjusting for demographics, indications, and other relevant comorbidities. A recent study reported a protective effect of ACEI/ARB exposure on mortality     . The associations we found support this finding, and we found similar associations for mechanical respiration requirements among infected patients. Further, our data did not show that other antihypertensive drug classes had any association with mechanical respiration requirements, though BB and CCB were associated with lower risk of death as well. While our data suggest a protective association between ACEI/ARB use and severe COVID-19 from two large New York hospitals (Columbia and Weill Cornell), our results are still preliminary, and caution should be taken in interpreting them. Because of the risk of residual confounding variables, prospective clinical trials would be necessary before clinical guidelines should be changed. For example, if some patients are more susceptible because they already express high levels of ACE2, this could help with targeting the ACE pathway in these patients as a prophylactic method. However, if the cells respond to infection with ACE2 expression, and this leads to the cytokine storm seen in patients, then this could be used as a downstream treatment (post-infection), for when ACE2 interacts with TMPRSS2, such as the ongoing trials with camostat mesylate     .

     Mitigating a fast-spreading pandemic, such as COVID-19, requires scalable diagnostic and screening methods     . Such a situation calls for fast, scalable tests readily implemented at home or point-of-care. This one-tube, dual-primer colorimetric SARS-CoV-2 assay has been clinically-validated with qRT-PCR, capture, and total RNA-seq, and thus can help increase testing options; moreover it has recently become available in several commercial forms. Our preliminary results here and elsewhere demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 detection from oral specimens is feasible and even optimal     . As such, a LAMP-based approach on such sample types could allow facilities to increase testing capabilities by orders of magnitude. Viral pandemics can have significant, long-lasting detrimental impacts for affected countries, and thus it is crucial to deploy methods that can track and profile cases (e.g., RNA-seq, LAMP, qRT-PCR, capture) and provide a comprehensive view of host and viral biology     . These methods can help mitigate the medical and socioeconomic harm from viral outbreaks, as well as establish protective surveillance networks that can help defend against future pandemics.

We also predicted a combined viral load score using Ct, GloMax QuantiFluor read-out from LAMP experiments and fraction of SARS-CoV-2 matching NGS reads in a sample. For this score (40-Ct), (LAMP read-out) and (log10(SARS-CoV-2 fraction + 1e − 6)) were all normalized between zero and one individually, and summed together using a combination weight of 5 for Ct, 3 for LAMP and 2 for NGS.

      Primers (Supplementary Table      ) were designed using PrimerExplorer (v4.0), as per guidelines in      to find LAMP-compatible primers for the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NCBI). LAMP’s inherent specificity (using 4–6 primers vs. 2 for PCR amplification), in combination with this in silico analysis, suggested little risk of cross-reactivity that might hinder specificity of N-gene primers sensitive for SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Data      ). Overall, chosen primers had less than 80% homology with the vast majority of tested pathogen sequences. For any organisms where a primer hit &gt;80% homology, only one of the six primers had significant homology making an amplified product extremely unlikely. Overall, the results of this analysis predict no significant cross-reactivity or microbial interference. We also assessed the potential impact of sequence variation in circulating strains that might lead to poor amplification. In the thousands of sequences deposited in GISAID (Shu and McCauley, 2017), only one site in the priming region was observed to be polymorphic. The polymorphism (T30359C) was only observed in 106 of 6753 (&lt;2%) sequences with coverage of this region. This variant overlaps the priming site of the LB primer but is not near a 3-prime end and is not anticipated to cause amplification failure. The data from Fig.      show the use of a single-tube, dual-primer protocol, wherein both the N2 gene and E-gene primers are present.

      Nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swab samples from 201 patients were collected (IRB 243/2020A Tuebingen) using a dry cotton swab (cliniswab DS, Aptaca Spa (Italy), #2170/SG/CS). Crude extraction was performed according to pending unpublished European patent [No. 20168 593.0]. In summary, the dry swab was transferred to a 15 ml falcon (Greiner Bio-one, #188.271), filled with 0.5 ml saline solution, and shaken vigorously for 30 min. Afterwards the liquid is transferred to a screw-cap (Sarstedt, #72.692.005). 10µl of the crude extract was added to 12.5 µl 2× NEB LAMP master mix (#M1800L), 2.5 µl of water, 1 µl 25× primer master mix Gen N, and was incubated at 65 °C for 30–40 min. A sample of a patient who tested positive using an approved qRT-PCR test (sample #1123) was used as an internal control. The read-out was performed visually by color change from pink to yellow or orange.

     <p id="Par48">
      The RNA isolation was performed with 50 µl of the crude extract on the QIAsymphony with the DSP Virus/Pathogen Kit (Qiagen, #937055). The RT-PCR was performed using 5 µl of 85 µl eluate with TIB MolBiol Lightmix      MODULAR SARS AND WUHAN CoV E-Gene Kit. Analysis was done with the LightCycler(R) 480 II software and calculated CP values were used for statics and graphical analysis. The Standard curve with a synthetic RNA control (Twist Bioscience, #MT007544.1) was generated using the LAMP assay and in parallel with the qRT-PCR. The control RNA was diluted serially tenfold with water and the absolute copy number, ranging from 10      to 10      was analyzed. Gel electrophoresis after visual read-out of the LAMP assay was done by loading 5 µl of the LAMP reaction with 5 µl 2× loading dye on a 1.5% agarose (Seakem LE Agarose, Lonza #50004) together with 5 µl of a 1 kB DNA Ladder (Roche). The electrophoresis was performed at 90 V constant.

     <p id="Par49">
      The photometric read-out of the standard curve was performed in a plate reader. To this end the LAMP reaction was transferred into a 96-well V-shaped cell-culture plate (Greiner Bio-One, #651180). After measuring the absorbances at 432 and 560 nm, the relative absorbance abs (432)/abs (560) was calculated by subtraction of the negative (water) control from all samples (including the negative control). All values above a threshold of 0.1 are considered as a positive assay read-out and are marked with “+”, all other values are negative and are marked “−”. Statistical and graphical analysis were performed with GraphPad Prism 8.0.4.

      Completed reactions were analyzed with the Promega GloMax Explorer (Promega GM3500) fluorometer using the QuantiFluor ONE dsDNA system (Promega E4871). This system recorded fluorometric read-out from each well using an emission filter of 500-550nm, an excitation filter set at blue 475 nm, and a high sensitivity setting on the Glomax software. Values were then tabulated and compared with controls (positive and negative). The intensity threshold of 2.5× negative control was used as the threshold for positive detection.

      DNAse treatment, rRNA depletion, and RNAseq library construction
     </title>
     <p id="Par51">
      For library preparation, all samples’ total nucleic acid (TNA) were treated with DNAse 1(Zymo Research, Catalog # E1010), which cuts both double-stranded and single-stranded DNA. Post-DNAse digested samples were then put into the NEBNext rRNA depletion v2 (Human/Mouse/Rat), Ultra II Directional RNA (10 ng), and Unique Dual Index Primer Pairs were used following the vendor protocols from New England Biolabs (except for the first flowcell, see      ). Kits were supplied from a single manufacturer lot. Completed libraries were quantified by Qubit or equivalent and run on a Bioanalyzer or equivalent for size determination. Libraries were pooled and sent to the WCM Genomics Core or HudsonAlpha for final quantification by Qubit fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific), TapeStation 2200 (Agilent), and qRT-PCR using the Kapa Biosystems Illumina library quantification kit.

      Taxonomic classification of sequence data
     </title>
     <p id="Par52">
      All complete genome or chromosome level assemblies from RefSeq database for archaea, bacteria, protozoa, fungi, human and viruses including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 genomes were downloaded and used for building a classification database for Kraken2 (

       k
      </italic>
      = 35, ℓ = 31)      .
     </p>
     <p id="Par53">
      To get an approximation for the positive and negative classification rate, the BBMap random-reads script was used to simulate 10 million 150 bp paired-end Illumina reads from the database sequences      . For the negative test all sequences in the database excluding SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 genome were removed from the sequences and the simulated reads were mapped with the Kraken2 database (Supplementary Data      ).
     </p>
     <p id="Par54">
      For the positive test, the same process was repeated using only SARS-CoV-2 genome (Supplementary Data      ). Positive results show &gt;99% of SARS-CoV-2 reads uniquely map to either SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, with the remaining 1% are ambiguous, potentially matching multiple taxa (Supplementary Data      ,      ). All sequences were classified using the Kraken2 database. To remove the potential contamination of reads that are homologous across multiple species we used Kraken2 outputs to filter sequences to either human (uniquely matching Homo sapiens and no other taxon in our database), SARS-CoV-2 (either matching SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 due to homology between these two viruses), and remaining reads that may be coming from unclassified, archaeal, bacterial, viral, fungal, protozoan or ambiguously mapping reads to human or SARS-CoV      .
     </p>
     <p id="Par55">
      Using kraken2 classifications common respiratory pathogens were identified in clinical samples. Any SARS-CoV-2 negative sample with &gt;0.01% relative abundance (normalized after the exclusion of any human, SARS-CoV-2 and uncharacterized reads) for presence of viral pathogens were classified as potential unrelated viral infection (Supplementary Fig.      ). These samples were used as controls during specific differential expression comparisons to compare the common effects of viral infections on host cells from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      Viral genome assembly

     <p id="Par56">
      Reads unambiguously mapping to SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 were aligned to the Wuhan-Hu-1 (Genbank accession MN908947.3) reference using bwa mem      . Variants were called using iVar, and pileups and consensus sequences were generated using samtools      . Any sample with &gt;99% coverage above 10× depth for SARS-CoV-2 genome were taken as reliable samples, which resulted in 155 samples (146 positive, 9 negative). 155 clinical samples were compared to 46,581 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GISAID (as of June 16, 2020)      . All sequence filtering, alignments, phylogenetic inference, temporal ordering of sequences, and geographic reconstruction of likely transmission events were done using Nextstrain      . Nextstrain was configured to generate a New York State-focused build. Sequence identity and coverage metrics were calculated using Mview      . Phylogenetic trees were created using Nextstrain’s augur as described above, and visualized using the ggtree package in R      .

     <p id="Par57">
      Full-length viral consensus sequences were aligned to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference using bwa mem      with default settings. Variants were identified by enumerating the coordinates and query/reference subsequences associated with mismatches (SNV) and gaps in the query (deletion) and reference (insertions) using R/Bioconductor (GenomicRanges, Rsamtools, Biostrings packages) and gChain (

      ACE inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker clinical cohort analysis

      We estimated the effects of ACEI/ARB exposure on COVID-19 using an observational case-control analysis of electronic health record data from two NYC hospitals (CUIMC and WCMC). Due to legal and institutional restrictions on data sharing, we performed the analysis at each site separately. We used data from clinical encounters occurring between March 10 and June 15, 2020. Our study included all individuals who received a valid SARS-CoV-2 swab test. We used two cohorts for comparison      : all individuals who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 swab test result and      all individuals from the first cohort who were exposed to any of four antihypertensive drug classes (ACEI/ARB, BB, CCB, and THZ). A patient was considered exposed to one of these drug classes if they received and filled a prescription for a drug in that class at any time in 2020.

      We considered two severe COVID-19 outcomes: intubation and death following confirmed infection. Individuals with a single positive test result were considered to have been infected and were included in our analysis. Intubation or death following confirmed infection was considered related to COVID-19. As we cannot determine from our data the date of infection, an individual became at risk of intubation and death due to COVID-19 7 days before their first positive test result or their first COVID-19 diagnosis. We determined mortality from a death note filed by a resident or primary provider that records the date and time of death. Intubation was used as an intermediary endpoint and is a proxy for a patient requiring mechanical respiration. We used note types that were developed for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection to record that this procedure was completed. In addition, we validated outcome data derived from notes against the patient’s medical record using manual review. As a comparison, we also performed a logistic regression using the same approach for the outcome of the infection test result itself using the full cohort of tested individuals.

      Using a combination of two cohorts and two severe outcomes, we made four propensity-matched, adjusted estimates of effect for ACEI/ARB. For comparison, we performed the same analysis using three other antihypertensive classes (BB, CCB, THZ). To inspect the degree of confounding due to covariates, we also estimated each effect with and without propensity matching and three levels of covariate adjustment. We used a Cox proportional hazards model for both outcomes. Propensity matching used logistic regression with the above 19 covariates using a 3:1 ratio of controls to cases in each of 100 propensity score bins, selecting none when the bin did not contain both cases and controls.

      The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA)

      The SOFA score is a severity of illness score that sums six separate organ dysfunction subscores, was used to characterize the burden of organ dysfunction. For the central nervous system, kidney, liver, and coagulation organ dysfunction subscores, traditional SOFA methodology      was used, based on patient status in the first 24 h following admission to the hospital (can be whatever time frame that you used). The respiratory SOFA subscore requires the selection of the lowest PaO2/FiO2 of the 24 h period and associates a lower ratio with a more severe dysfunction score, in situations outside of an ICU setting a PaO2 is often not available. We used a commonly accepted imputation technique to impute a PaO2 from a SpO2      . The cardiovascular SOFA subscore was updated with additional vasopressors according to a norepinephrine equivalency table from a clinical trial      . Specifically, phenylephrine and vasopressin were converted to a norepinephrine equivalency. Missing data for each subscore was treated as normal.

After whole tissue images stitched, we applied customized render setting to each tissue since tissue background and target protein expressions are highly sample-dependent. Roughly, the min and max of the render setting is from 20 to 200 and 1000 to 15,000, respectively. For each tissue sample, we collected four types of functional tissue regions; vascular zone, large airway, alveoli zone, and macrophages. Each tissue region was carefully selected by a board- certified pathology and then segmented with corresponding fluorescent tissue markers. Twenty-four to twenty-three GeoMx DSP samples were selected per tissue.

These gene count estimates were then divided by their respective negative normalization factor to normalize the data. For the Differential expression analysis, focus was given to the 207 Alveolar AOIs because they contained the bulk of the data. Of the 1837 genes, 1796 passed our criterion of limit of quantification (LOQ &gt; 2).

The software includes removal of low-quality reads, alignment to the SARS-CoV-2 genome (NC_045512.2), and elimination of off-target reads by alignment to other genomes including human (GrC38) and 26 additional microbial genomes. Presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 was determined by calculating coverage of NC_045512.2 at 1× depth using a sliding window analysis (window size 1000 and step size 100) and determining the integral under the curve. After log transformation, we used a cutoff of 8.6 (for samples with &lt;10,000 bases on target), and 9.6 (for samples with &gt;10,000 bases on target) to call presence or absence. The pipeline also calls germline variants that differ from the reference genome (NC_045512.2) and estimates viral titer using a multivariate model of coverage and evenness across the viral genome      .
