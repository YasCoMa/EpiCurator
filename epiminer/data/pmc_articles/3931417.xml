   In HIV-1 infection, plasma viral load (VL) has dual implications forpathogenesis and public health. Based on well-known patterns of HIV-1 evolutionand immune escape, we hypothesized that VL is an evolving quantitative traitthat depends heavily on duration of infection (DOI), demographic features, humanleukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes and viral characteristics. Prospective datafrom 421 African seroconverters with at least four eligible visits did showrelatively steady VL beyond 3 months of untreated infection, but host and viralfactors independently associated with cross-sectional and longitudinal VL oftenvaried by analytical approaches and sliding time windows. Specifically, theeffects of age, HLA-B*53 and infecting HIV-1 subtypes (A1, C and others)on VL were either sporadic or highly sensitive to time windows. Theseobservations were strengthened by the addition of 111 seroconverters with2â€“3 eligible VL results, suggesting that DOI should be a criticalparameter in epidemiological and clinical studies.
