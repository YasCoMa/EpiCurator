   Two analyses of HIV-1 subtype C Gag quasispecies were performed in a prospective cohort of 42 acutely and recently infected individuals by SGA on viral RNA/proviral DNA templates. First,

   Gag substitutions were assessed in relation to the HIV-1C consensus sequence, which revealed that 29.3% of detected amino acid substitutions can be classified as reversions to subtype consensus, 61.3% as forward substitutions from subtype consensus, and 9.3% as polymorphisms not associated with the subtype consensus sequence. Second, the proportion, dynamics, and relationships within individual pools of viral quasispecies were analyzed. Among reverse substitutions, 16.1% were minor, 11.0% transient, 13.6% dominant, and 59.2% fixed. In contrast, 31.6% of forward substitutions were minor, 59.3% transient, 3.8% dominant, and 5.3% fixed. The distinct patterns in the spectrum and dynamics of reverse and forward Gag substitutions suggest that these differences should be considered in HIV-1 evolutionary studies and analyses of viral mutational pathways.
