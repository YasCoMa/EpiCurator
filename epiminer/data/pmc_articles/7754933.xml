  Design of a multi-epitope-based vaccine targeting M-protein of SARS-CoV2: an immunoinformatics approach
 </title>
 <abstract>
  <p>
   In the present study, one of the targets present on the envelopes of coronaviruses, membrane glycoprotein (M) was chosen for the design of a multi-epitope vaccine by Immunoinformatics approach. The B-cell and T-cell epitopes used for the construction of vaccine were antigenic, nonallergic and nontoxic. An adjuvant, β-defensin and PADRE sequence were included at the N-terminal end of the vaccine. All the epitopes were joined by linkers for decreasing the junctional immunogenicity. Various physicochemical parameters of the vaccine were evaluated. Secondary and tertiary structures were predicted for the vaccine construct. The tertiary structure was further refined, and various parameters related to the refinement of the protein structure were validated by using different tools. Humoral immunity induced by B-cells relies upon the identification of antigenic determinants on the surface of the vaccine construct. In this regard, the vaccine construct was found to consist of several B-cell epitopes in its three-dimensional conformation. Molecular docking of the vaccine was carried out with TLR-3 receptor to study their binding and its strength. Further, protein–protein interactions in the docked complex were visualized using LigPlot+. Population coverage analysis had shown that the multi-epitope vaccine covers 94.06% of the global population. The vaccine construct was successfully cloned

   into pET-28a (+). Immune simulation studies showed the induction of primary, secondary and tertiary immune responses marked by the increased levels of antibodies, INF-γ, IL-2, TGF-β, B- cells, CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Finally, the vaccine construct was able to elicit immune response as desired.

     Introduction
    </title>
    <p>
     The outbreak of Coronavirus disease − 19 (COVID-19) is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome – related Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) has brought the world to a standstill (Dagur &amp; Dhakar,     ). The outbreak of SARS-CoV2 had its origin in Wuhan, China (Prasad &amp; Prasad,     ). It has now spread to over 216 countries. The number of confirmed cases crossed 29 million, with more than 0.9 million confirmed deaths reported worldwide (

     —covid-19/ accessed on 23 July 2020). COVID-19 outbreak is the result of transmission of the virus to humans from animals (Gorbalenya et al.,     ). There is neither a drug nor a vaccine available for SARS-CoV2 (Prasad &amp; Prasad,     ).
    </p>
    <p>
     SARS-CoV2 belongs to the genus – Betacoronavirus, Subfamily – Orthocoronavirinae, Family – Coronaviridae, Suborder – Cornidovirineae and Order – Nidovirales. MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV also belongs to the same genus Betacoronavirus (Gorbalenya et al.,     ). The genome of the SARS-CoV2 is a positive sense single stranded RNA that acts as mRNA immediately after its release into the host cell. The genome of coronavirus is approximately 20 kb–30 kb. Two-third of the genome of Coronavirus towards 5′ - end is made up of two overlapping open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b that codes for the synthesis of several nonstructural proteins. ORF1a is translated and results in the synthesis of ORF1a polyprotein. However, due to ribosomal frame shifting, the ribosome continues to translate the ORF1b resulting in the synthesis of ORF1ab polyprotein. Cleavage of the mature peptide of ORF1ab gives rise to the following peptides – nsp2 to nsp4, nsp6 to nsp11, 3C-like proteinase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, 3′- to 5′-exonuclease, endoRNAse and 2′-O-ribose methyltransferase. Remaining one-third of the genome of Coronavirus towards 3′-end is made up of structural proteins consisting of Surface Glycoprotein (S), Envelope (E), Membrane Glycoprotein (M) and Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N). Interspersed between these four structural genes are ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a–ORF7b, ORF8 and ORF10 genes (NCBI Accession MT434760) (Graham et al.,     ; Joshi et al.,     ; Kim et al.,     ; Prasad &amp; Prasad,     ).
    </p>
    <p>
     Membrane glycoprotein is the most abundant protein in the Coronaviruses (Rottier,     ). As the name indicates, the ‘M’ protein is embedded in the viral lipid bilayer. The N- terminal end is exposed outside and the C- terminal end is present inside the virus with three transmembrane helices embedded in the lipid bilayer (Bianchi et al.,     ; Kumar et al.,     ). It is an important glycoprotein that alone plays an important role in intracellular budding (Kumar et al.,     ; Rottier,     ; Tang et al.,     ). It is different from the remaining glycoproteins of Coronavirus in terms of its structure and function (Rottier,     ). It is flanked on its 5′-end by gene ‘E’ coding for Envelope protein and towards 3′ – end by gene ORF6 (NCBI Accession MT434760).
    </p>
    <p>
     Vaccines provide protection from infectious diseases (Thomas &amp; Luxon,     ). For the successful development of a vaccine candidate till its release into the market takes considerable amount of time as it needs to qualify in different phases in the clinical trials along with the huge investment involved. However, at times, the rate of success of the vaccine is also bleak. In such a scenario, Immunoinformatics approach is helpful in reducing the time taken for the development of vaccines compared with the conventional approaches and there are examples of the successful development of vaccine candidates by adopting

     approaches (Ada et al.,     ; Bhatnager et al.,     ; He et al.,     ; Kim et al.,     ; Oli et al.,     ; Patronov &amp; Doytchinova,     ; Tordello et al.,     and the appropriate references cited therein). The whole genome sequence of the SARS-CoV2 is made available in the public domain by next generation sequencing. This enabled the design of several multi-epitope

     vaccine candidates targeting different structural and nonstructural proteins of the SARS-CoV2 (Bhatnager et al.,     ; Bhattacharya et al.,     ; Devi &amp; Chaitanya,     ; Dong et al.,     ; Enayatkhani et al.,     ; Kar et al.,     ; Lizbeth et al.,     ; Peele et al.,     ; Samad et al.,     ). In the present study, we aimed to design a novel multi-epitope vaccine targeting membrane glycoprotein by immunoinformatics approach.

Apart from this, it is more efficient in predicting new HLA-I/CTL epitopes compared to NetMHCpan and NetCTL tools (Stranzl et al.,      ). The output of the programme gives prediction scores for MHC- I binding affinity, TAP transport efficiency, Proteasomal C terminal cleavage, Ligand combined score and Percentage rank. Threshold for epitope identification was set at its default value of 1.0. The peptides whose %Rank was less than 1.0 were considered qualified for further analyses.

      Population coverage analysis
     </title>
     <p>
      HLA genotype frequencies vary across different populations in the world. The nature of HLA polymorphism has its influence on the binding of a given peptide derived from the multi-epitope vaccine to HLA-I/II molecules (Bui et al.,      ). Therefore, it is important to know the extent of coverage of world population by the multi-epitope vaccine constructed in the present study. To determine this, IEDB Analysis Resource available at

      was used for the prediction of tertiary structure of the protein (Roy et al.,      ). In the first step, it employs LOMETS, a meta-server threading programme for template-based protein structure prediction. It contains 11 threading programs. Each threading programme generates many templates from PDB that are aligned with the query sequence. However, only one template that has shown the highest

      -score from each of the threading programs is selected. Subsequently, 10 threading programs are ranked. Thus, the output from LOMETS contains the top 10 threading programs along with their respective high score template. Using the templates generated from LOMETS, in the next series of steps, I-TASSER generates top five final models. Each model is given a Confidence score (

GalaxyRefine2 is an advanced version of ‘GalaxyRefine’, utilizes local operators and global operators as well as local error estimation and homology structure information for the improvement of the accuracy of the structure of the input protein (Lee et al.,      ). It generates 10 refined models and provides information related to RMSD, MolProbity, Clash score, Poor rotamers, Rama favored and ‘GALAXY energy’ for all the ten models in comparison with the user submitted model. The refined model obtained from GalaxyRefine2 was used as a final vaccine candidate for docking and

      Docking of the vaccine with TLR-3
     </title>
     <p>
      TLRs (Toll Like Receptors) are immune receptors play an important role in eliciting immune responses against infection by bacteria and viruses. Adjuvants have an ability to induce innate and adaptive immune responses upon their interaction with TLRs. In the present study, β – defensin was included in the vaccine construct as an adjuvant for enhancing the efficacy of the vaccine. It acts as an agonist for TLR3. As a result, docking study was carried out between TLR3 (Receptor) and Vaccine (Ligand) to study the binding affinity of the ligand with the receptor (Bhatnager et al.,      ; Pandey et al.,      ).
     </p>
     <p>
      Docking of the Vaccine with TLR-3 (PDB: 1ZIW) was performed online using PatchDock available at
      <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/PatchDock/php.php">

      (Andrusier et al.,      ; Mashiach et al.,      ). FireDock yields a refined output consisting of the ranked list of the top 10 models generated by PatchDock.
     </p>
     <p>
      DIMPLOT under LigPlot + v2.2 was used for studying the interactions between the residues of Chain-A (TLR-3) and Chain-B (Vaccine construct) in the docked complex.

Apart from this, additional options such as (i) avoid rho-independent transcription terminators, (ii) avoid prokaryotic ribosome binding sites and (iii) avoid cleavage sites of restriction enzymes, were selected for the generation of the optimized DNA sequence corresponding to the input amino acid sequence of the vaccine construct.

      cloning of the DNA sequence (obtained from JCat) into pET-28a (+) vector. Prior to cloning, the DNA sequence of the vaccine construct was verified for the absence of specific restriction enzyme recognition sites that were to be utilized for cloning into the vector. After confirmation, those restriction enzyme sequences were added on N- terminal and C-terminal regions of the vaccine construct for successful cloning.

      (accessed on 25 July 2020) was used to simulate the immune response of host for the vaccine designed in the present study. A new fast Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) was utilized in C-IMMSIMM for the prediction of epitopes that binds to HLA molecules. Further, the strength of interaction of a given peptide-HLA complex with a T-cell receptor is scored using Miyazawa–Jernigan residue–residue potential in the tool (Rapin et al.,      ). For the immune-simulation studies, host HLA selection consisted of heterozygous combination of HLA-A (HLA-A*01:01, HLA-A*02:01), HLA-B (HLA-B*15:01, HLA-B*57:01) and HLA-II (DRB1_0101, DRB1_1302). These HLA molecules were randomly chosen from among the HLA alleles, whose interacting peptides were utilized for the construction of multi-epitope vaccine. Three injections of the vaccine (without LPS) were given at four weeks interval with the following time steps (one time step corresponds to 8 h): 1, 84 and 168. (Nain et al., 2020; Shey et al., 2019). Rest of the parameters viz. Random seed, simulation volume, number of antigens to inject were set to their default values except for ‘Simulation Steps’ that was set to 1050.

       BepiPred predicted a total of five epitopes. Of these, three epitopes were more than 10 amino acids long. Among the three epitopes, two were found to be nonallergic, nontoxic and antigenic. Hence, these two epitopes, KLGASQRVAGDS and RYRIGNYKLNTDHSSSSDNIA were included in the vaccine construct (       ).

       Unlike BepiPred, which predicts B-cell epitopes that are continuous in a linear peptide sequence, DiscoTope predicts B-cell residues present on the surface of the three-dimensional structure of a protein. This implies that those residues what are distant in a linear peptide sequence, can come close when the protein assumes three-dimensional conformation to form a B-cell epitope (Kringelum et al.,       ). DiscoTope at a threshold of −3.7 identified 25 B-cell epitope residues (residue numbers 172, 182, 186, 188, 192, 195–196, 202–203, 207–211, 213–223) out of 223 total residues (       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       The final vaccine construct consists of both linear and discontinuous epitopes as determined from the results obtained using BepiPred and DiscoTope, respectively, which can induce humoral immune responses. This was also evident from the results obtained from Immune simulation.

      <p>
       All the T and B- cell epitopes in the present study were screened for their antigenicity, allergenicity and toxicity. Only those peptides which were antigenic, nonallergic and nontoxic were used in the present study for the design of vaccine construct. The final vaccine construct (223 amino acids) was found to be antigenic in all the three models viz. Tumor (threshold: 0.49), Virus (threshold: 0.4) and Bacteria (threshold: 0.4). It was also found to be nonallergic.

      Design of vaccine construct

     <p>
      The final vaccine construct is 223 amino acids long (      ). It consists of a total of six HLA-I, two HLA-II and two B-cell epitopes. Apart from this, at the N-terminal end, β-defensin was included in the vaccine construct for increasing the immunogenicity of the multi-epitope vaccine. β-defensin acts as an adjuvant and elicits antiviral responses (Kim et al.,      ; Lei et al.,      ). β-defensins are anti-microbial peptides involved in eliciting innate immune responses. Apart from this, β-defensin interact with the immune receptors such as TLRs or CCR6 and induces innate and adaptive immune responses (Lei et al.,      ). It is used as an adjuvant in the construction of several vaccines by Immunoinformatics approach (Ali et al.,      ; Bhatnager et al.,      ; Dong et al.,      ; Narula et al.,      ).

      Apart from β-defensin, PADRE (pan DR epitope) sequence was also included in the vaccine construct to increase the immunogenicity of the vaccine construct as well as to enhance the T-cell help (Alexander et al.,      ; Sarkar et al.,      ; Wu et al.,      ). PADRE sequence acts as a TLR agonist adjuvant. It is a 13 amino acid long synthetic peptide that has an ability to effectively induce CD4+ T cell help. It has got several advantages, e.g. ability to bind to most of the HLA-DR molecules, clinically safe for humans and more potent than other universally available T

      cell epitopes (Ghaffari-Nazari et al.,      ). In the present study, it is placed at the N-terminal end between β-defensin and HLA-I epitopes and was connected to these two by EAAAK and AAY linkers, respectively.

      In the present study, EAAAK linker was attached at the N-terminal end of the vaccine construct (Mittal et al.,      ; Sarkar et al.,      ) and was also used to join the β-defensin sequence with PADRE sequence (Sarkar et al.,      ). EAAAK is a rigid α-helix forming peptide linker, with intramolecular hydrogen bonding having a closed packed backbone. Rigid linkers possess several advantages when compared to the flexible linkers. EAAAK linkers offer efficient separation of the functional domains by keeping a fixed distance with minimal interference between the epitopes thereby maintaining their individual functional properties (Chen et al.,      ). This helps in the effective separation of domains in a bifunctional fusion protein (Arai et al.,      ).

     <p>
      GPGPG linker was used to join the HLA-II epitopes (Livingston et al.,      ; Sarkar et al.,      ) in the present study. GPGPG linker was designed by Livingston et al. (      ) as a universal spacer (Li et al.,      ). GPGPG linkers were demonstrated to be able to induce T
      <sub>
       H
      </sub>
      lymphocyte (HTL) responses which is crucial for a multi-epitope vaccine. Further, GPGPG linker is a valuable tool in breaking the junctional immunogenicity, which leads to the restoration of immunogenicity of the individual epitopes. This was experimentally demonstrated by Livingston et al. (      ) in mice models.
     </p>
     <p>
      HLA-I epitopes were joined by AAY linker (Bhatnager et al.,      ) in the present study. AAY (Ala-Ala-Tyr) linker is the cleavage site for the proteasomes in mammalian cells. Therefore, epitopes joined using AAY linker gets separated effectively within the cells; thereby reducing the junctional immunogenicity. AAY linker also increases the immunogenicity of the multi-epitope vaccine (Yang et al.,      ).
     </p>
     <p>
      In the present study, KK linker was used to join the B-cell epitopes (Gu et al.,      ; Nain et al., 2020; Sarkar et al.,      ). The Lysine linker is the target for the Cathepsin B, a lysosomal protease involved in processing of the antigenic peptides for their presentation on the cell surface in an MHC-II restricted antigen presentation. It also plays a crucial role in reducing the junctional immunogenicity by avoiding the induction of antibodies for the peptide sequence that individual epitopes can form when they are joined linearly (Yano et al.,      ). KK linkers also increase the immunogenicity (Li et al.,      ).
     </p>
     <p>
      Linkers play an important role in minimizing the junctional immunogenicity and also in preserving the identity of each individual epitope during the processing of the vaccine within the cells thereby ensuring the immunogenicity of each epitope (Bhatnager et al.,      ; Meza et al.,      ; Shey et al.,      ). A multi-epitope vaccine without linkers may result in a new protein with unknown properties or may result in the formation of neoepitopes/junctional epitopes (Livingston et al.,      ; Meza et al.,      ).

       IFN-γ inducing epitope prediction
      </title>
      <p>
       IFN- γ is a cytokine that modulates various immune responses. It is mainly secreted by activated T- cells and Natural Killer cells. It plays an important role in promoting macrophage activation, enhancing the antigen presentation, activation of the innate immune system, promoting antiviral and antibacterial immunity, etc. (Tau &amp; Rothman,       ). IFNepitope generated a total of 215 epitopes. Out of these, 88 epitopes had positive score and 127 had negative score. The IFN-γ inducing epitopes constitute around 41% of the total number of peptides. This is consistent with the results obtained from the Immune-simulation studies (       ) which had showed an increase in the levels of IFN-γ at all the three stages of the immune response towards the vaccine.

       Molecular weight and theoretical pI of the protein was 24.9 kDa and 10.16, respectively. Based on the theoretical pI of the vaccine, it is basic in nature. Extinction coefficient of the protein was found to be 45,840 M       cm       at 280 nm when all Cys residues are reduced. Total number of negatively charged residues (Asp + Glu) is nine and the total number of positively charged residues (Arg + Lys) is 37. Estimated half-life was 1 h in mammalian reticulocytes (

       Immune simulation results obtained from C-ImmSim showed increased levels of IgM + IgG, IgM, IgG1 and IgG1 + IgG2 antibodies in the secondary and tertiary immune responses when compared to primary immune response. IgM and IgM + IgG antibodies were seen in the primary immune response. However, the peaks depicting the titers of IgM and IgM + IgG are distinctly separated in the secondary and tertiary responses than in primary response. There is a decrease in the levels of antigen at each stage of immune response with the increase in the levels of antibodies (       ). The decrease in antigen count is also attributed to the increase in the total count of B (       ) and T-lymphocytes. Apart from B-lymphocytes, active (       ) and total T

     Conclusion
    </title>
    <p>
     In the present study, a vaccine was designed against membrane glycoprotein of SARS-CoV2 by different
     <italic>
      in silico
     </italic>
     tools. T-cell and B- cell epitopes were designed using different online servers that are efficient in predicting the epitopes. Only those epitopes which are antigenic, nonallergic and nontoxic were used for the construction of vaccine. Epitopes were joined by different linkers to reduce junctional immunogenicity and also for efficient separation and presentation to T-cell and B- cell receptors. Population coverage analysis (using the epitopes that were used for the construction of the vaccine) had shown that the vaccine can cover 94.06% of the world-wide population. Secondary and tertiary structures were predicted for the protein. Subsequently, the tertiary model generated was further refined and validated. Molecular docking was performed between the vaccine construct and TLR-3 receptor. Various molecular interactions, i.e. hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, etc. were visualized between the protein and TLR-3 receptors. Condon optimization was carried for cloning and expression of the vaccine in
