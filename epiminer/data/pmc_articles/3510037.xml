 <abstract>
  <p>
   Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an epithelial malignancy facilitated by Epstein-Barr Virus infection. Here we resolve the major genetic influences for NPC incidence using a genome-wide association study (GWAS), independent cohort replication, and high-resolution molecular HLA class I gene typing including 4,055 study participants from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Guangdong province of southern China. We detect and replicate strong association signals involving SNPs, HLA alleles, and amino acid (aa) variants across the major histocompatibility complex-HLA-A, HLA –B, and HLA -C class I genes (P

   = 6.8×10   respectively). Over 250 NPC-HLA associated variants within HLA were analyzed in concert to resolve separate and largely independent HLA-A, -B, and -C gene influences. Multivariate logistical regression analysis collapsed significant associations in adjacent genes spanning 500 kb (OR2H1, GABBR1, HLA-F, and HCG9) as proxies for peptide binding motifs carried by

   NPC is a deadly throat cancer in China that is dependent on EBV infection. Here, we performed a 1 M SNP genome-wide association study using a large cohort of Chinese study participants at risk for NPC. Although several putative gene regions show significant associations, the strongest statistical signals involved scores of variants within the HLA region on chromosome 6. HLA poses a formidable association-genetics challenge because of extensive linkage disequilibrium, rather low allele frequencies, and multiple physically close interacting genes of diverse function. We examined over 250 NPC-HLA associated variants detected with sequence-based nucleotide alleles and amino acid variants. The multiple associations were collapsed to implicate causal signals by multivariate logistical regression to resolve allele association interaction. One operative variant was identified as the HLA-A*11:01 allele motif, specifically in the peptide binding groove, which recognizes invading antigens; a second involved two aa sites with HLA-B tracking B*13:01 and B*55:02 alleles. We synthesize these new and previous discoveries to help resolve the important gene influences on this disease.

     Introduction
    </title>
    <p>
     Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an epithelial malignancy with highly variable incidence rates around the world. An estimated 84,400 incident cases of NPC and 51,600 deaths occurred in 2008 with the highest incidence in South-Eastern Asia, relative to the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Central and Eastern Asia     . An early indicator of NPC development is the occurrence of immunoglobulin (Ig)A antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) capsid antigens (EBV-IgA/VCA).     ,     NPC incidence for individuals expressing IgA/VCA antibodies were 31.7 times higher than the incidence in the age matched general population.     Linkage and family studies indicated that genetic predisposition also plays an important role in NPC onset and susceptibility.     ,     Among host genetic markers implicated as associated with NPC, the highly variable class I human leukocyte antigen (
     <italic>
      HLA
     </italic>
     ) genes on chromosome 6 (6p21.3) have shown a strong and consistent association with NPC risk.     ,     ,     ,     ,     ,     ,     _ENREF_7 HLA class I association studies across mainland China     ,     , Taiwan     ,     , and Singapore     have consistently demonstrated that HLA-A*11 and B*13 are associated with NPC resistance, while A*02 (A*02:07), A*33, B*46 and B*58 are associated with increased NPC susceptibility (     ). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been applied to numerous complex diseases to implicate common risk variants through well powered genetic studies     ,     ,     . Recent GWAS also affirmed a strong HLA influence on NPC incidence and implicated four additional non-HLA genes, however extensive linkage disequilibrium across the gene dense HLA region have confounded identification of the causal association gene(s).     ,     ,
    </p>
    <p>
     To refine and extend these reports, we explore here the operative factors of genetic association for this disease in a comprehensive four step study utilizing: 1) A GWAS utilizing 591,458 SNPs resolved by Affymetrix 6.0 genotyping platform to identify gene regions associated with NPC; 2) SNP genotyping to replicate the top signals in a second independent NPC cohort; 3) High resolution
     <italic>
      HLA
     </italic>
     molecular genotyping to identify specific alleles and haplotypes associated with NPC; and 4) Amino acid variant analysis to fine map the major genetic determinants associated with this disease. The analyses demonstrates that two independent association signals, specifying peptide binding grove motifs in HLA-A and in HLA –B drive the signals tracked by scores of SNP and amino acid variants that are association proxies for the HLA class I NPC association.

    <p>
     We performed a GWAS with 1104 southern Chinese individuals from NPC-phase II study cohorts     ,     (See     ) using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide SNP 6.0 genotyping platform. After SNP- and sample-base quality control (     ), 591,458 SNPs genotyped in 1043 study participants (567 cases and 476 controls;     , line I). Principal components analysis confirmed that all samples came from individuals of Southern Chinese ancestry (     ,     ,     ,     ,     ). A quantile-quantile plot of the observed p-values showed a clear deviation from the null distribution which suggested that the most significant lower p-values are smaller than those expected by chance and likely reflect genetic association (     ). The GWAS allele associations suggested a strong influence in the
     <italic>
      HLA-A
     </italic>
     region of chromosome 6 and weaker signals on chromosome 16 and 17 (     ).
    </p>
    <p>
     Twenty-four SNPs (     ) with p-values less than 5×10     in 16 association tests (     ) and sixteen previous GWAS reported NPC associated SNPs (     ) and were selected for replication. Replication SNP genotyping was conducted in an independent Chinese cohort that included 356 NPC cases and 629 controls (     , line II). Six of 40 SNPs that showed genome-wide significant NPC association and replication were within 500 kb of each other in the
     <italic>
      MHC
     </italic>
     region of chromosome 6 (     ,     ). The most significant SNP rs417162 (

     A fine-grain view of the pattern of GWAS SNPs around the
     <italic>

     locus is illustrated in     . An extensive cluster of associated
     <italic>
      HLA-A
     </italic>
     region SNPs that approach or exceed genome-wide association threshold p-values (p&lt;10     ) is apparent within 500 kb including associations in the adjacent

     </italic>
     and
     <italic>
      GABBR1

     Discussion
    </title>
    <p>
     We present and interpret a 1 M SNP GWAS, in subjects from Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Guangdong province of southern China, where perhaps the highest recorded NPC incidence has been found.     ,     ,     ,     Multiple genome wide significant association signals were evident with the HLA gene region and in a few other chromosomal regions (     ). Because the HLA region is complex and displays extensive LD, we sought to resolve the causal association signals with several different approaches. These included replication in an independent cohort from the same area, sequence based gene typing of the HLA-A, -B and -C genes, and analysis of sequence based nucleotide alleles as well as 284 amino acid site variants across the HLA genes (     ). We compared association signals of SNPs, aa variants, HLA- alleles defined by molecular typing and associated HLA –A, -B and C haplotypes. To resolve the operative variants from proxies that track signals by LD, we enlisted a multivariate logistical regression of alleles and site variants with the strongest signals (     ,     ). Finally we revisited and attempted replication in our cohort reports from other NPC gene associations including GWAS recently published,     ,     ,     (TNFRSF19 -CHR 13, MDS1-EVI1-CHR 3, and CDNK2A/2B- CHR 9;     ) affirming gene influence that are important in this disease.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the present study, two independent powerful association signals within the HLA region were resolved for NPC, amidst a background of scores of adjacent associated LD-proxy variants. The first influence involved the HLA-A*11:01 allele sequence and function, specifically in the peptide binding groove, which recognizes invading antigens. This conclusion derives from several lines of evidence: 1.)
     <italic>
      HLA-A*11:01
     </italic>
     is a common allele in the populations (
     <italic>
      F
     </italic>
     = 0.25) and is the only “protective” allele with genome wide significant
     <italic>
      HLA-A
     </italic>
     signal (OR = 0.59;
     <italic>
      P
     </italic>
     = 1.7×10     ;     ) the strongest of all HLA alleles. 2.) HLA-A*11:01 is included in the significantly associated protective HLA haplotypes (     ); 3.) 100% of associated SNPs and aa variants about HLA-A, including those in adjacent genes, namely the
     <italic>
      HCG9
     </italic>
     , and
     <italic>
      GABBR1
     </italic>
     loci, are proxies HLA-A*11:01(     ;     ); 4.) HLA-A*11:01 carries five strongly significant associated aa variants (62Gln, 276Leu, 114Arg, 70Gln, and 97Ile) in its peptide binding groove (     ). Taken together, the HLA-A association is centered on HLA-A*11:01 allele function and tracked by internal and closely linked proxy aa and SNP variants.
    </p>
    <p>
     It may also be relevant that the sequence of
     <italic>
      HLA-A*11:01
     </italic>
     allele (
     <italic>
      F
     </italic>
     = 0.25 in this population) differs by only one amino acid residue (Lys19Glu) from that of the
     <italic>
      HLA-A*11:02
     </italic>
     allele (
     <italic>
      F
     </italic>
     = 0.04), yet
     <italic>
      HLA-A *11:02
     </italic>
     shows no apparent association with NPC onset. Both
     <italic>
      HLA-A*11:01
     </italic>
     and
     <italic>
      HLA-A*11:02
     </italic>
     alleles share a unique peptide binding motif signature of “.[YT]……[K-]” (     ) and an identical sequence within the defined residues of the antigen recognition site.     Since the only Lys19Glu residue difference between the two
     <italic>
      HLA-A*11
     </italic>
     alleles is outside the peptide binding region, the possibility of an alternative mechanisms for NPC pathogenesis, e.g.
     <italic>
      HLA-A/KIR
     </italic>
     innate immunity involvement     or dendritic cell interaction,     should be considered and explored in future studies.
    </p>
    <p>
     We further demonstrate an independent
     <italic>
      HLA-B
     </italic>
     signal derived from three representive alleles, two protective alleles (
     <italic>

     <italic>

     . Both

     *35 rapid AIDS progression reported previously.     ,     ,     All the NPC associations were genome wide significant in one or more analyses, replicated internally in independent Guangxi cohorts and externally in other genetic association studies in Asia. Our study demonstrates a powerful genetic influence on NPC onset in Chinese people, implicates explicit

     </italic>
     disease associations are likely to involve multiple mechanisms. A recent study in HIV disease showed that allelic diversity of HLA-C can cause variation in the level of surface expression of the HLA-C molecule, which in turn affects viral load control and disease progression     , perhaps through both HLA-restricted CTL responses and HLA/KIR-mediated NK cell activities. The functional basis for HLA associations with NPC should be explored fully, now that the genetic basis of this disease is well-characterized, in hopes of explaining the complex HLA association with NPC in the Chinese population.

      A total of 4055 study subjects (1405 NPC cases and 2650 controls,      ) were recruited in two independent collection phases: phase I -April 2000 to June 2001 and phase II-November 2004 to October 2005, from the Guangxi autonomous region and Guangdong province of southern China.      All study subjects were of Han ethnic origin and reside in the catchment area of the Xijiang River. IgA antibodies to EBV capsid antigen (EBV-IgA/VCA) were confirmed by serologic testing for all the subjects at the time of study enrollment. In phase I, the case group included 356 unrelated patients with biopsy-confirmed NPC. The mean age was 50.1 years (range 19–80), 95.5% of them were EBV-IgA/VCA antibody positive. Controls included case spouses or geographically matched residents who were NPC free at the time of study enrollment. An additional 422 adult children of the study subjects were enrolled for haplotype inference and for quality control assessment, but they were excluded in association analyses. In phase II, the case group included 1049 unrelated patients with biopsy-confirmed NPC. The mean age was 46.3 years (range 10–77), 96.3% of them were EBV-IgA/VCA antibody positive. Two distinct NPC-free control groups were included; one group was positive (N = 1001) and the other negative (N = 1020) for the EBV-IgA/VCA antibody. The mean ages were 46.1 and 46.6, for the antibody positive and negative controls groups. All study subjects were self-reported Guangxi or Guangdong provincial ancestry for either maternal or paternal ancestry for at least three generations.

      A total of 598 NPC cases and 506 controls were randomly selected from phase II enrollment cohort for GWAS analysis. DNA was extracted from whole blood by traditional phenol/chloroform method with phase Lock Gel tube (Qiagen, MaXtract High Density, catalog # 129065). The genome-wide genotyping experiments were conducted by using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide SNP Array 6.0 genotyping platform. 325 nanograms of DNA per sample were prepared for both Sty1 and Nsp1 restriction enzyme digestion for this assay, genotyping in according to the manufacturers instructions.

       Genotyping analysis of GWAS samples was performed in Genotyping Console 3.0.2 for first-pass quality control. The contrast quality control (CQC) metrics were computed by the Affymetrix software. We attempted to ascertain genotypes for 1,104 NPC study subjects. 11 samples failed genotyping or were removed because of failing CQC (&lt;0.4) or call rate (&lt;90%). An additional 17 samples failed to meet further QC filters which included heterozygosity &lt; = 25% and at least one enzyme specific CQC value (Nsp1 or Sty1) &gt;1. 24 samples were removed because the genotypes determined in the GWAS were discordant with genotypes previously determined by the Laboratory of Genomic Diversity for candidate gene studies. The gender of the samples was determined from the heterozygosity of X chromosome SNPs (Affymetrix and PLINK software) and by the ratio of the mean intensity of the copy number probes on the Y chromosome to the mean intensity of a subset of copy number probes on the X chromosome (Affymetrix software). Four samples were removed because the gender determined from the genotypes was discordant with the gender provided by the cohort. Identity by descent (IBD) statistics computed using PLINK software were used to detect cryptic familial relationships. Four first degree relationships were observed (3 full sib pairs and 1 parent-offspring pair). For each of these pairs, the sample with the lowest call rate was removed. A fifth sample was removed because the IBD statistics were consistent with that individual having a first cousin relationship with five other subjects. After sample filtering, a number of 1043 subjects were remained for further analyses (       ).

      High resolution HLA molecular typing was performed for all 1,405 unrelated NPC cases and 2,650 unrelated controls from both enrollment cohorts. HLA class I alleles were characterized using a PCR-SSOP (sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe) typing protocol developed by the 13th International Histocompatibility Workshop      for the first enrollment study cohort (N = 985), and using a DNA sequence-based typing (SBT) protocol in the second enrollment study cohort (N = 3070). The sequencing analysis was performed using the ABI Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit and the ABI3730xl DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). HLA alleles were assigned on the basis of the sequence database of known alleles with the help of the ASSIGN software developed by Conexio Genomics (Conexio Genomics, Western Australia, Australia). Ambiguous heterozygous genotypes were resolved by additional PCR and sequencing procedures using allele-specific PCR primers to selectively amplify only one of the two alleles.

      Because the most significant NPC associated SNPs is located on the HLA class I region (see      ), an amino acid analysis was carried out to evaluate the role of functional relative amino acid residues in HLA associations.

      Proxy SNP–variant analysis
     </title>
     <p>
      We have used the method of testing each variant for reduced-p-values in multi-variants models resulting from co-linearity of variants to recognize LD and independence of signals in the association of NPC with HLA-A, -B and -C. Multicollinearity in logistic regression models is a result of strong correlations between variables. The existence of multicollinearity (high r      ) between variants inflates the variances of the parameter estimates. That will likely result in lowered p-values for a given SNP that was determined to be in significant association with NPC when tested signally. We used a reduction in significance as an indicator that two variants were in strong LD, and therefore not independent signals as has been done by recent authors      . This gives us a general idea about independence of the signals within HLA and adjacent genes within the context of the disease association. However, we recognize that although multicollinearity may lower magnitudes of regression coefficient estimates and resulting p-value significance in cases of LD, this method may be subject to error such as when a rare SNP on a haplotype does not have a large effect on the model. These methods are provided as an indicator of independence, but not as a definitive measure in our understanding of the disease.

      Statistical analysis

     <p>
      We performed logistic regression model analysis for all SNPs passing the quality control filters, using a Cochran-Armitage trend, co-dominant, dominant, recessive, and allelic model taking the number of copies of the rare allele 0, 1 or 2, as the explanatory variable. The comparisons were conducted between NPC cases and NPC free controls, NPC cases and NPC-free but EBV-IgA/VCA antibody positive controls (EP controls), NPC cases and NPC-free but EBV-IgA/VCA-antibody negative controls (EN controls), EP controls and EN controls respectively. Population structure/stratification was assessed using the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) module of Eigensoft software      . Study samples were first run together with HapMap individuals of European, African, and Asian descents to identify any potential admixed individuals. Later, PCA analyses of only the study samples were conducted. Initially all autosomal SNPs that passed the quality control filters were used to estimate the contribution of each SNP to the top ten eigenvectors. Previously reported correlated genome regions      (such as on chromosomes 6, 8, and 11) were observed and excluded from the following PCA analyses. Moreover, to avoid any confounders due to LD among the SNPs, the genotype data was pruned to 90 K independent SNPs distributed throughout the genome by PLINK prior to the PCA analyses. The logistic regression analysis performed using PLINK      , controlling for gender, age and the first three eigenvectors; the significance was evaluated using the log likelihood test. SNPs were sorted according to the lowest P-value in a combined set of samples in one of these models. The chi-square tests were used for testing case-control association for allele effects. HLA allele frequencies were calculated based on observed genotypes; HLA-A, -B and -C haplotype were assigned based on maximum likelihood estimation using the SAS/Genetics HAPLOTYPE procedure. The effect of HLA alleles on the development of NPC and EBV-IgA/VCA antibody was evaluated by computing odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using logistic regression. For HLA allele and haplotype test, P values were calculated by logistic regression and then corrected by the Bonferroni, which was multiplied by the number of all detected alleles or haplotypes. Significance was considered at P&lt;0.05 after correction.
